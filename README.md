# arch-install-mbp
Automated Arch Linux Install for Dual-Boot on a Macbook Pro

## Goals:
* Automate installation in a manner similar to that found [here](https://disconnected.systems/blog/archlinux-installer/).
* Use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks to configure the system; discriminating between development and server builds.
* Have _fun_ !
